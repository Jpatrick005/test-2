Using Vectors
1. There is a built-in vector LETTERS contains the uppercase letters of the alphabet and letters which contains the lowercase letters of the alphabet.
```{r}
LETTERS
letters
```
Based on the above vector LETTERS:
a. You need to produce a vector that contains the first 11 letters.
```{r}
letters[1:21]
```
b. Produce a vector that contains the odd numbered letters.
```{r}
letters[seq(1, length(LETTERS), by = 2)] 
LETTERS[seq(1, length(LETTERS), by = 2)]
```
c.Produce a vector that contains the vowels
```{r}
letters[c(1, 5, 9, 15, 21)]
LETTERS[c(1, 5, 9, 15, 21)]
```
